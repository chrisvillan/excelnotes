'dwFlags Controls various aspects of mouse motion and button clicking. This parameter can be certain combinations of the following values.
'dx The mouse's absolute position along the x-axis or its amount of motion since the last mouse event was generated
'dy The mouse's absolute position along the y-axis or its amount of motion since the last mouse event was generated
'cButtons If dwFlags contains MOUSEEVENTF_XDOWN or MOUSEEVENTF_XUP, then dwData specifies which X buttons were pressed or released. This value may be any combination of the following flags.
'dwExtraInfo An additional value associated with the mouse event. An application calls GetMessageExtraInfo to obtain this extra information.
